Directly managed up to 6 development engineers, and indirectly managed 4 additional customer-centric engineers. Helped to oversee the design and development of HDFS erasure coding, Hadoop-compatible S3/Azure connectors, review the development of HDFS snapshots, and the release of Apache Hadoop 3.0, the first new major release of Hadoop in many years. Responsible for interfacing with both support and product management functions focused on HDFS. Worked with many other engineering teams within Cloudera which built primarily on top of HDFS.\n\n2013-2014 - Tech Lead for Cloudera's HDFS team. Worked closely with the both the product and people managers of the HDFS team to prioritize work, design new features, and address customer problems. Worked with other members of the Apache Hadoop open source community to advance all aspects of HDFS development.\n\n2011-2013 - Worked as a software engineer on the HDFS team. One of the primary developers of HDFS's High Availability feature, but also contributed many other smaller features, especially in the areas of metadata durability, Hadoop security, and HDFS NFS gateway access. Was one of the top contributors to open source HDFS during this time. Also a great deal of hands-on customer support, both after-hours and to assist Cloudera's full-time support staff. Became a Hadoop Committer and PMC Member.\n\n2010-2011 - Worked as a software on Cloudera Desktop, which is in some ways the predecessor of both Cloudera Hue and Cloudera Manager. On this team I introduced two major features: user/group sync with LDAP, and a file system search feature for HDFS called \"Headlamp\". I also led the integration of Cloudera Desktop with core Hadoop's then-new Kerberos authentication system.",

Sure, he's a bad ass developer who has the work stamina of a pack of mules, but all that takes a back seat when you consider his razor sharp wit. No, you can't softball things over the plate with ATM and not expect him to drive it out of the park. Even a curve ball rarely gets by him. Simply put, working next to ATM means that you have to bring your A game not only in your own work to live up to his shining example of productivity and elegant code, you have to do it while sparring with him mentally. He keeps you sharp, on your toes. As much as this \"recommendation\" is a warning, I'd welcome the opportunity to work with him again if for no other reason than it would keep me in shape."

By the time I left, it was about 3000 people.\n\nHDFS (2012-2017):\n\nHDFS is the most successful open-source distributed storage system. I joined as one of three engineers developing HDFS at Cloudera, and became the tech lead for a team of ten.\n\nSome project highlights:\n\n- Led development of erasure coding, a new method of storing data that reduces storage costs by more than 50%. This was a multi-year project that involved novel research ideas and coordinating 20+ developers across multiple companies and multiple timezones. This is the biggest and most complex effort we've ever shipped in HDFS.\n- Release manager for Apache Hadoop 3.0, the biggest release of Hadoop ever. This was spurred by our desire to ship erasure coding, and required coordinating with multiple feature owners and downstream ecosystem dependencies over the course of more than a year of alpha and beta releases. I made substantial improvements to our release tools, process, and testing along the way. Hadoop 3.0 was the foundation of Cloudera 6, Cloudera's first major release in five years.\n- Became an Apache Hadoop committer, PMC member, and Apache Member due to my open-source contributions. Mentored multiple coworkers and community contributors into becoming committers and PMC members themselves.\n- Presented at conferences including Strata Hadoop World, Hadoop Summit, Apachecon, Apache Big Data, and USENIX ATC.\n\nAltus (2017-2019)\n\nAltus was Cloudera's Platform-as-a-Service offering, making it easy to run machine learning and data engineering workloads on the cloud.\n\n- Led development of a cloud-native machine learning platform built on Kubernetes.\n- Made improvements to Altus core services, observability, and build/test/deploy infrastructure.",

This pivot gave me the opportunity to grow my skills in a very different direction.  I was fortunate to work with a growing non-profit where I not only learned about completely new-to-me concepts like fundraising and distribution, but also how the benefits of quality data management can impact operations for non-profits.  I have an expanding appreciation for the intersection of data quality and efficiency within organizations of all shapes and sizes and would love to use what I've learned to help teams gain efficiency in all aspects of their businesses and/or missions.\n\nStrengths include:\nProcess Improvement\nData Modeling + Organization\nAirtable Interface Design + Build\nEmail Automations\nWebsite Maintenance",

I never saw her commitment in her job waiver yet she didn't take herself too seriously. She was professional but warm and though very, very busy (she knew all there was to know about our solution) she would still gladly make time for anyone who was invested in learning and contributing more to our work. I still keep in touch with Abby and she will do amazing things as an ambassador at START.",

It was amazing for both the work I was involved in and the free time I had to discover myself while meeting many wonderful people. That internship lead to a permanent position as a park ranger in Yosemite. In this role I offered top level customer service to people from all over the world and found ways to provide creative insights and solutions alongside my NPS colleagues. Highlights included a 5 month detail overseeing our campground volunteer program and many wonderful personal relationships built over time with repeat visitors.\n\nIn April 2020, I moved on from the National Park Service to pursue a new career in the ever-changing world of software technology as a Customer Support Advocate for Airtable. With this evolution in my career I aimed to continue to provide top-level customer care while learning about and experimenting with new ways to share information in a remote-friendly world with a thirst for visually pleasing content. \n\nI've since moved on to be a technical writer, KMS system manager, and AI chatbot optimizer as part of Airtable's Self-serve Support team.\n\nMy aspirations outside of work are to remain active outdoors through my love of backpacking, climbing, and running. I also endeavor to continue exploring the world of art through music and other mediums.\n\nSpecialties: Customer Service, research, data entry and manipulation, supervision, and exploring creative solutions",
